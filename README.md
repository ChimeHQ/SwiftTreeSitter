# SwiftTreeSitter

Swift API for the [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/) incremental parsing system.

SwiftTreeSitter is fairly low-level. If you are looking a higher-level system for syntax highlighting and other syntactic operations, you might want to have a look at [Neon](https://github.com/ChimeHQ/Neon).

ðŸ“– [Documentation][documentation] is available in DocC format.

## Integration

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ChimeHQ/SwiftTreeSitter")
]
```

## Language Parsers

Tree-sitter language parsers are separate projects, and you'll probably need at least one. More details are available in the [documentation][documentation]. How they can be installed an incorporated varies. Since you're here, you might find SPM the most convenient.
